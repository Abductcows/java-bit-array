# java-bit-array
Java array of bit values that uses 1 bit per entry. I have not looked at any implementations of the BitSet java class.
My plan is to make an ArrayList-like api with some added functionalities like intersect 

Internally the bits are stored in `long` primitives

I will add a more sound description of the implementation once I have finished the basic methods
